# Anomaly Detection in Time Series

This project demonstrates anomaly detection in time series data using an LSTM neural network.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `BRITANNIA.csv`.

## Code

The code is provided in the Jupyter Notebook `AnomalyDetectionTimeSeries.ipynb`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook from the `notebooks/` directory and run the cells.

## Import required libraries
## Load and preprocess data
## Build and train the LSTM model
## Predict and identify anomalies
## Visualize the results
